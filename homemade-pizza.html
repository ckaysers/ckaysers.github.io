                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>250g strong bread flour</li>
                        <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
                        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>150ml warm water</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                        <li>200g tomato passata</li>
                        <li>1-2 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
                        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
                        <li>1-2 tbsp grated Parmesan</li>
                        <li>125g mozzarella, sliced</li>
                        <li>Fresh basil leaves, to garnish</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin by preparing the dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the strong bread flour, instant yeast, and salt. Gradually add the warm water, stirring until the mixture forms a soft, pliable dough. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Drizzle with 1 tbsp of olive oil, cover with a damp cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours.</li>
                        
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 240°C (220°C for fan ovens) or Gas Mark 9. Meanwhile, prepare the tomato sauce by gently simmering the tomato passata, crushed garlic, and dried basil for 10-15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then set aside to cool.</li>
                        
                        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down to remove any air bubbles, and then transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough to your desired thickness and shape, and place it onto a parchment-lined baking tray.</li>
                        
                        <li>Spread the cooled tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan, and top with sliced mozzarella.</li>
                        
                        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. Remove from the oven, and allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before garnishing with fresh basil leaves.</li>
                        
                        <li>Slice the pizza into even portions and serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade pizza, brimming with authentic flavours and a delightfully crisp crust.</li>
                        </ol>
            
                        <p>Feeling adventurous? Don't hesitate to get creative with your pizza toppings! From classic Margherita to enticing gourmet combinations, the possibilities are truly endless. Remember, the key to a perfect pizza lies in the quality of the ingredients and the love you put into making it.</p>
